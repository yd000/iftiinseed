    question: 'Can anyone make a campaign?',
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          Pennyseed is limited to persons 13 years and older in the United
          States. Plus campaigns you create must be approved by us (though we
          are very likely to approve them).
        </p>
        <p>
          But even before we approve your campaign, you are still free to share
          your campaign with others, whom can pledge at anytime. Charges will
          only be made if we have approved the campaign before the deadline, as
          well as whether the minimum number of pledgers are met.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I edit my campaign after I create one?',
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          No. After you create a campaign, you cannot edit it, including the
          title, description, funding goal, min/max number of pledgers, and the
          deadline. This is to ensure the pledgers know what they&apos;re going
          to pay and when.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, if you want to raise $1,000 with a minimum of 1,000
          pledgers, each will pay at most $1 before fees. But if you changed the
          minimum number of pledgers to 100 after people have pledged, then
          they&apos;ll pay at most $10, which wouldn&apos;t be fair and
          wasn&apos;t the deal when they pledged.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How many Campaigns can I make at a time?',
    answer: () => (
      <p>
        You are limited to 1 active campaign at a time. Once the campaign&apos;s
        deadline has passed (or if you choose to delete it before the deadline
        passed), you can create another campaign.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to create an account to pledge?',
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          Yes. We thought about allowing people to pledge without an account by
          just putting in their card information, but what if they changed their
          mind before the deadline? By having pledgers create an account they
          can choose to cancel their pledges at any time before the deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want, you could create an account, pledge to a campaign, and
          then delete your account after the campaign ends. Then you could come
          back and do it again for other campaigns you want to pledge to.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a directory of all campaigns I can look through?',
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          No. We think it&apos;s better to allow users to create a campaign and
          share the campaign link on their existing social networks. We just
          want to be a way for people to pay creators whose content they enjoy -
          nothing more.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we added a way to search and discover campaigns, then we&apos;d
          have to moderate which campaigns are created since they&apos;d be seen
          by anyone visiting this site. Plus we&apos;d have to deal with
          malicious users impersonating popular creators and would need to add
          stuff like account verification.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&apos;d prefer to just have users make campaigns and share the
          direct link to the campaign on their existing social media accounts,
          leveraging the established trust of those accounts.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I set a username or profile picture?',
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          No. When you create an account, you can only create campaigns or
          pledge to other campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Campaigns do not display any information about the campaigner -
          otherwise malicious users could impersonate popular creators online
          and trick people into pledging to them.

    question:
      "What if someone creates a campaign for $1,000 and I'm the only pledger? I don't wanna end up paying $1,000!",
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          All campaigns require a <u>minimum number of pledgers</u> that ensures
          a maximum possible pledge amount will be paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, raising $1,000 with a minimum number of 100 pledgers
          ensures that if less than 100 people pledge then no one will pay
          anything. But if 100 people pledge then each will pay $10, which is
          the most they can possibly pay. Any more than 100 pledgers will result
          in a pledge amount less than $10 (e.g. if 200 people pledge then each
          pays $5, if 500 people pledge then each pays $2, and if 1,000 people
          pledge then each pays $1). All the pledge amounts described above are
          before fees.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How much of the campaign funding goal does Pennyseed take?',
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          We take 1% of successful campaigns, but the campaigner doesn&apos;t
          get any less money than they asked for. We do this by pre-calculating
          our 1% and raising the pledge amount so the final amount is the
          expected amount.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, due to{' '}
          <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Stripe&apos;s processing fees
          </a>{' '}
          (2.9% + 30Â¢ per transaction), we raise the pledge amount a little more
          so the final payment after fees are deducted is what&apos;s expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if 1,000 people pledge to raise a total of $1,000, then
          each would not pay $1, but around $1.35, resulting in $1 for the
          campaigner after{' '}
          <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Stripe&apos;s processing fee
          </a>{' '}
          ($0.34) and Pennyseed&apos;s 1% fee ($0.01) are taken away.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What's the lowest amount a pledger can pay?",
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          The minimum possible pledge amount is $0.50, due to{' '}
          <a
            href="https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Stripe&apos;s minimum charge amount
          </a>
          . Therefore, we set the upper limit on the possible number of pleders
          to <span className="underline">2 times the funding goal</span> so the
          least you&apos;ll pay is $0.50 (before fees).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a funding goal with $1,000 can only have a maximum of
          2,000 pledgers, each paying $0.50 (before fees) if 2,000 pledge.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What's the highest amount a pledger can possibly pay?",
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          The highest possible pledge amount is $999,999.99, due to{' '}
          <a
            href="https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Stripe&apos;s maximum charge amount
          </a>
          . Therefore, we set the lower limit on the minimum number of pledgers
          to <span className="font-medium">(funding goal) / 999,999.99</span>{' '}
          (rounded up), which would be just 1 if the funding goal is less than
          $999,999.99.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the most you can possibly pay (before fees) is $999,999.99,
          which is extremely unlikely since the person making the campaign would
          have to set the minimum number of pledgers to the lowest possible
          allowed number.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you wanted to raise $1,000,000, the lowest minimum
          number of pledgers 2 pledgers, where if only 2 people pledged
          they&apos;d each pay $500,000 before fees. Of course you would set the
          actual minimum number of pledgers to something much higher like
          200,000, where if at least 200,000 pledged they&apos;d each pay $5
          before fees
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my pledge visible to others?',
    answer: () => (
      <p>
        No. All pledges are anonymous, being neither visible to the public nor
        the campaigner themself.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "If I get a lot of pledgers, won't a lot of the pledge amount just be processing fees?",
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          Yes. As the pledge amount decreases the larger the bulk of the pledge
          payment due to fees. For instance if you raise $1,000 with 2,000
          pledgers each will pay $0.84, which becomes $0.50 when fees are
          deducted.
        </p>
        <p>
          As inefficient as this may seem, we think it&apos;s way better than
          having a small percentage of followers pay larger amounts, which
          usually results in a lower profit for the creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course down the road we could look at ways of optimzing this, such
          as:
        </p>

        <ul role="list">
          <li>Asking Stripe for custom pricing due to our unique model</li>
          <li>
            Asking for outside investments to cover part of the processing fees
          </li>
          <li>
            As customers pledge to multiple campaigns, we can charge them in one
            lump sum (e.g. 2 pledges at $1 each would be $1.34 + 1.34 = $2.68
            separately, or $2.37 as a single transfer
          </li>
          <li>
            Customers can put larger amounts into an digital wallet that we can
            subtract from when they make pledges, e.g. adding $103.30 ($100
            before fees) to the digital wallet and pledging $1 100 times (vs
            pledging $1.34 individually 100 times resulting in $134 total)
          </li>
          <li>
            Providing alternate payment methods that have lower fees (e.g.
            cryptocurrencies), though that may be tricky due to conversion rates
          </li>
        </ul>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "What if I'm not willing to pledge the maximum possible pledge amount?",
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          If you&apos;re not willing to pay the maximum pledge amount, you can
          just wait until more people pledge and the (funding goal) / (current
          number of pledgers) is low enough for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance a campaign raising $1,000 with a minimum of 100 pledgers
          implies a maximum possible pledge of $10. If you and 99 others pledge
          by the deadline then you&apos;ll pay $10. However you could not pledge
          and just wait for more than 100 to pledge before you pledge yourself,
          e.g. if 500 people pledge so you&apos;ll be paying around $2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this would work campaigns may not succeed because
          everyone&apos;s waiting for everyone else to pledge first. Instead the
          campaigner can raise the minimum number of pledgers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But later on we may add a feature where you can &quot;pledge
          later&quot; and automatically pledge when the campaign reaches some
          pledger-defined pledge amount, e.g. waiting for 500 pledgers so you
          ensure you&apos;ll be paying $2 despite the actual minimum being 100
          pledgers.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "What if a campaign succeeds but one of the pledger's payment methods is expired (or otherwise invalid)?",
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          If a campaign succeeds at the time of charging pledgers one (or more)
          of the pledger&apos;s payment methods are invalid (e.g. the card
          expires between when the payment method was added and the campaign
          ends), we will still charge the other pledgers.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, it is possible that the campaigner may receive less than
          they asked for (minus the number of failed payments multiplied by the
          pledge amount). For instance, if you try to raise $1,000 and 1,000
          pledge, then each will pay $1 before fees, but if 1 pledger&apos;s
          payment method fails, then the campaigner will receive $999.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s unfortunate, but cancelling the entire campaign instead and
          trying it again doesn&apos;t seem fair. The pledgers will still pay
          the same amount (specifically the maximum pledge amount) they agreed
          to when they pledged.
        </p>

  {
    question: 'What incentives do people get for pledging?',
    answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          At the moment Pennyseed is just a glorified donation website with some
          logistics. Ideally the satisfaction of having supported your fellow
          person should be enough, but that isn&apos;t enough nowadays.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if people who actually knew how to make real production
          websites took over, you could use your pledge as a key to access
          special content and stuff, similar to Patreon and Gumroad.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cool incentive would be for a creator to have recurring campaigns
          where each campaign&apos;s funding goal raises an extra $100 or so
          that gets distributed to pledgers from previous campaigns, like a
          dividend.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would incentivize people to not only support their favorite
          creators, but incentivize people to pledge much higher amounts for
          niche creators that may have very few followers (e.g. someone with 50
          followers that needs to raise $1,000, each paying $20).
